=Defining a Column Alias=
-Renames a column heading
-Requires double quotation marks if it contains 
spaces or special characters or is case sensitive

EXAMPLES:
SELECT last_name AS name, commission_pct comm FROM employees;

SELECT last_name "Name", salary*12 "Annual Salary" FROM employees;
                    Notice that the optional "AS" keyword has been used before the column alias name)



==Concatenation Operator==
-Concatenates columns or character strings to other columns 
-Is represented by two vertical bars (||)
-Creates a resultant column that is a character expression

EXAMPLES:
SELECT last_name||job_id AS "Employees" FROM employees;



==Literal Character Strings==
-A literal value is a character, a number, or a date included in the SELECT list.
-Date and character literal values must be enclosed within single quotation marks ('').
-Each character string is output once for each row returned.

EXAMPLES:
SELECT last_name ||' is a '||job_id AS "Employee Details" FROM employees;

OUTPUT:
King is a AD_PRES



==Duplicate Rows==
Unless you indicate otherwise, iSQL*Plus displays the results of a query without eliminating duplic ate 
rows. The example on the slide displays all the department numbers from the EMPLOYEES table. Notice 
that the department numbers are repeated.

=Eliminating Duplicate Rows=
To eliminate duplicate rows in the result, include the DISTINCT keyword in the SELECT clause 
immediately after the SELECT keyword.
In the example on the slide, the EMPLOYEES table actually contains 20 rows but there are only seven unique department numbers in the table. 
You can specify multiple columns after the DISTINCT qualifier. The DISTINCT qualifier affects all the 
selected columns, and the result is every distinct combination of the columns.

EXAMPLE:
SELECT DISTINCT department_id, job_id FROM employees;
