/*
A SELECT statement retrieves information from the database. Using a SELECT statement, you can do the 
following:
• Projection: You can use the projection capability in SQL to choose the columns in a table that you 
want returned by your query. You can choose as few or as many columns of the table as you require. 
• Selection: You can use the selection capability in SQL to choose the rows in a table that you want 
returned by a query. You can use various criteria to restrict the rows that you see.
• Joining: You can use the join capability in SQL to bring together data that is stored in different tables 
by creating a link between them. You learn more about joins in a later lesson

SELECT *|{[DISTINCT] column|expression [alias],...}
FROM table;
• SELECT identifies what columns
• FROM identifies which table
